This project is a simple re-creation of the basic Google homepage.

It is the first HTML/CSS project as part of 'The Odin Project'
located at www.theodinproject.com.

It's my first attempt at building a site 'from scratch' using CSS.
It's extremely sloppy, a little lazy, and over all a bit of a mess
from a code standpoint, but dammit I'm learning!
